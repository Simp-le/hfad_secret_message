# Description
An application for encrypting messages. It consists of three screens: a welcome screen, a screen for entering a message, and a screen for displaying this message in encrypted form. When you switch back from the last screen, you move to the welcome screen. The application uses fragments to display screens, the fragments themselves are displayed in the FragmentContainerView, which contains the NavHostFragment navigation host. The safeargs plugin is used to send messages between screens.
